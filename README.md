# Sumobots_Setup

At sumobots we design & program sumobots that battle each other! 

To get started all you need to do is download the Arduino IDE at https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

We have some test & example code you can run to get familiar with arduino and peripherals   

Here are the slides that explain the sensors, drivers, and other peripherals we use
